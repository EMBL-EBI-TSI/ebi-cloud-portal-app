			<h3>Single Sign On</h3>
		<p>EBI Cloud Portal can be accessed using Single Sign On with <a href="https://lifescience-ri.eu/ls-login/users/how-to-get-and-use-life-science-id.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LS</a>
      associated account or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.embl.de/">EMBL</a> account. <abbr title="Life Science">LS</abbr> 
      has associated with different Identity providers like Google, <abbr title="Open Researcher and Contributor IDentifier">ORCID</abbr>, LinkedIn,
      institutional accounts, etc. If you have an account with any of the <abbr title="Identity Provider">IdP</abbr>s, you can proceed with registering with LS,
      the Single Sign On process involves email verification, and finishes with a "We've got your registration" message from LS.</p>
<p> When you first log in to the EBI Cloud Portal, you will first be asked if you allow your home institution (or Google, etc) to
  release your data to LS, where you can choose to allow/disallow the release of your data to the EBI Authentication Gateway.
  EMBL SSO involves just asking to login EMBL account. </p>
<p>Let us see the process step by step in the following video.</p>

			<h3>Adding your own Applications</h3>
			<p>
				Although the EBI Cloud Portal community lists many well known applications, including both
				infrastructure and bioinformatics ones, you can also add applications developed by you if they
				are properly packaged for the EBI Cloud Portal to use. See the Application developer
				documentation <a href="">here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Applications are added from the Repository section of the portal.Click on
				<img style="height: 1em; width:1em;" [src]="menuSymbol">, the side navigation bar appears. Click on
				<em>Repository</em> which will then take you to repository page where you can manage <em>Applications</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following video explains how to add your own application from a GitHub repository.

			<h3>Creating a Configuration, from scratch</h3>
			<p>
				A <em>Configuration</em> is a way of reusing and sharing cloud credentials and parameters for Applications. In order to be able to
				deploy an Application in a cloud resource, we need to provide cloud credentials (<em>Cloud Provider</em> parameters) and possibly
				additional parameters (<em>Deployment Parameters</em>) that are specific to the cloud resource (e.g. network IDs, etc).
			</p>
			<p>It can be a tedious process to introduce these parameters each time we want to deploy an Application. Moreover, some of these
				are technical details that can be provided by the user managing the cloud resource we are going to deploy to. For that
				reason, the EBI Cloud Portal introduces the concept of Configuration as a way of encapsulating all that information
				so it is easy to define, reuse, and share.
			</p>
			<p>
				Configurations can be shared with you by other users, but you can also create your own. Let's see how. Click on
				 <img style="height: 1em; width:1em;" [src]="menuSymbol">, a side navigation bar appears. Click on 'Profile' which
				 will then take you to profile page where you can add, share and remove Cloud Providers, Configurations, and Deployment Parameters.
		  </p>
			<p>
				The following video guides you through the whole process.

			<h3>Your first Deployment</h3>
			<p>
				The final goal of the EBI Cloud Portal is to make easy to deploy useful applications into the cloud. Once we have
				available both, the Application we want to deploy, together with a working Configuration, we can proceed to deploy
				just with a few clicks.
			</p>
			<p>
				Click on <img style="height: 1em; width:1em;" [src]="menuSymbol">, the side navigation bar appears. Click on
				<em>Repository</em> which will then take you to repository page where you can manage <em>Applications</em>.
		  </p>
			<p>
				The following video guides you through the process of Deploying an Application using the previously created Configuration (see previous videos).
