			<h3>Single Sign On</h3>
			<p>If you don't have an <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org/register">ELIXIR</a> associated account, you need to
			create one using one of the supported providers (Google, institutional account, etc.).
			</p>
			<p>
			This involves email verification, and finishes with a "We've got your registration" message from ELIXIR.
			When you first log in to the EBI Cloud Portal, you will first be asked if you allow your home institution (or Google, etc)
			to release your data to ELIXIR, where you can choose to allow/disallow the release of your data to the EBI Authentication Gateway.
			</p>
			<p>Let's review the process step by step</p>
			<p>Here you make use of the SSO (single sign on) button.</p>

			<p>You can sign in using Google, Linkedin, ORCID accounts or your institution login.</p>

			<img style="height: 90%; width:90%; margin-top: 1em;" border="1" [src]="loginSSOStepOne">
